# Weather Dashboard

## Description

As a frequent traveler, I want an app that shows the local weather for multiple cities so that I can plan accordingly.

I learned how to integrate the use of server-side API's into a webpage.

## Usage
Type in a city to display the current and five day weather forecast.  Utilize your recent searches by clicking on the city in the search history to display the weather.  Recent searches will populate upon refresh.
