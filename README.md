# Weather Dashboard

## Description

As a frequent traveler, I want an app that shows the local weather for multiple cities so that I can plan accordingly.

I learned how to integrate the use of server-side API's into a webpage.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

Thank you to the askBCS team for helping me problem solve a few issues.  
Thank you to my tutor, Sandy Smith, for going over the gist of the project.
Thank you to my tutor, Benicio Lopez, for helping me code lines 37-46 to display the recent city search.
